What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git then knows that the files in the current directory are to be treated as
	a logical unit that will be version controlled in the future. It's impossible
	to version control all the files on the HDD therefore version control system
	needs to know which files are to be maintained, hence need to initialise the
	repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory contains all the files that form the project you are working
	on, staging area allows you to choose *some* of the files from the working area
	to include in the repository. Repository is a collection of all the changes and
	actual files that have been committed with relevant comments. It may contain 
	only some of the files from working directory or all of them but it also has
	some metadata as well (commit comments).
