When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Collaborating with other people on a project or working on a few different machines,
  changes made on one PC can then be synced onto different devices. On top of that, if
  the files are only stored locally, any hardware failures would result in you losing
  the files.
