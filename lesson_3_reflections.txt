When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Collaborating with other people on a project or working on a few different machines,
	changes made on one PC can then be synced onto different devices. On top of that, if
	the files are only stored locally, any hardware failures would result in you losing
	the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It's similar to why git by default requires you to manually commit changes to files.
	Also, if you want, you could work on the files in the repository locally, then just
	push the changes to the remote when you are online or satisfied with the modifications
	(which may end up in the public repository that other people can view).
